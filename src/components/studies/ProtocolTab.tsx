      <h1>Beyond the Care Dyad: Bridging Dementia Caregivers with eHealth</h1>
      <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
      <p>Background: Supporting persons with dementia living at home often relies upon complex care networks extending beyond the primary caregiver-person with dementia (PWD) dyad. Effective communication, coordination, and collaboration (CCC) within these networks are fundamental for optimal care and caregiver well-being 1, yet these processes frequently encounter considerable barriers.3 Electronic health (eHealth) technologies present potential pathways, conceptualized in this research as digital "bridges," to support these networks.7 However, a persistent gap, often termed the "pilot-to-practice chasm," exists between the development and evaluation of such technologies and their successful implementation and sustainability in routine practice, suggesting some bridges remain "too far".</p>
      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Dementia represents a significant and growing global health challenge, marked by progressive cognitive deterioration that profoundly impacts individuals' functional capacity and quality of life. Enabling persons with dementia (PwD) to reside in their own homes for as long as feasible frequently necessitates complex care arrangements.</p>
